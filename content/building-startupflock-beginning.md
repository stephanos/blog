This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Hopefully. If not, it will be a beautiful failure. I will attempt something I always wanted to do: Create a useful application, from top to bottom. Additionally, I will create something I always wanted to read: A journal - not a tutorial - of the process. Let's dive right in.


### The Idea

Roughly three years ago, I was searching for a job in Berlin.
TODO


### The Goal

My goals for this endeavor are twofold.

 - create a website that helps people discover great startups
 - help startups to make themselves known in their local community
 -

 - learn new stuff, get outside of comfort zone


### The Process

I'll follow the ideas of the [Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) movement and [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) methodology:

  - **MVP (minimum viable product):**
the product needs to go live as soon as it can offer some value to users, even if I'm embarrassed by it

  - **release early, release often:**
I'll need a simple and fast deployment pipeline to get code to production as soon as possible in order to reduce turn-around time and receive feedback on changes quickly

  - **actionable feedback:**
I'll need to track metrics that help me validate assumptions about the product - but also qualitative feedback will be useful to drive the development ("Build–Measure–Learn")

  - **visualize the workflow:**
I'll need a way to organize the necessary work and be able to quickly see what the next important steps are


My first step: I created a very simple [Trello](https://trello.com) board to organize the work to be done. It's my Kanban board. I add cards into 'Backlog' and keep this list sorted by priority. When I have time to work on something, I drag the card into 'Working on'. One I finish it, I move it to Done.

Notice the last column titled 'Ideas'. I will insert any ideas - technical and product related - in there. If an idea still sounds promising after a while, it can be removed and split into actionable cards in 'Backlog'.
